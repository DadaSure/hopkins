# Introduction
Hopkins statistic for determining cluster tendency.

The Hopkins statistic, is a statistic which gives a value which indicates the cluster tendency, in other words: how well the data can be clustered.

- If the value is between {0.01, ...,0.3}, the data is regularly spaced.

- If the value is around 0.5, it is random.

- If the value is between {0.7, ..., 0.99}, it has a high tendency to cluster.
